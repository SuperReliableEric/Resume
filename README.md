# Resume

This repository contains the source for my resume, written in LaTeX.

The PDF is generated from the LaTeX source and published on my personal site.

## Editing

I edit this resume using Overleaf for convenience, but the source can be compiled locally with a standard LaTeX toolchain.

## Output

The compiled PDF is included in this repository for easy access.
